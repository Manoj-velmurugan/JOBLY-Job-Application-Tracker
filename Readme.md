## Live Demo

-   **Backend:** [**Render API**](https://jobly-job-application-tracker.onrender.com/api)

> **Note:** The first login may take a few seconds to load. This is due to the backend server being hosted on a free-tier platform, which may go into a "sleep" state when inactive. Subsequent logins are faster.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
-   Node.js (v14 or higher)
-   npm
-   MongoDB Atlas account (or a local MongoDB instance)

### Backend Setup
1.  **Navigate to the backend folder:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Create a `.env` file** in the `backend` folder and add the following variables:
    ```env
    PORT=5000
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key
    ```
4.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

### Frontend Setup
1.  **Navigate to the frontend folder** from the root directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Create a `.env` file** in the `frontend` folder and add the following:
    ```env
    VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
    ```
    *Note: Change this to your deployed backend URL for production.*
4.  **Start the frontend development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
5.  Open your browser at `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in the terminal).

## Known Issues / Notes
-   **Initial Login Delay:** On the first login, the live server may take a few seconds to respond due to the free-tier hosting. Subsequent logins are faster.
-   **Free-Tier Limitations:** The hosted backend may "sleep" after a period of inactivity. Reviewers may experience a slight delay on their first access.
